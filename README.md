# inventory system
hello fellows i have made another (probably useless) thing, this time in python (unsurprising)
this lets you use commands such as `add(item)` and other random stuff to control an inventory

## usage rules
if you want to use this, just credit me (heysailboat, or just link this repo) in your README or in a comment at the top of your python files using it. (or just a credits.md page would also work)

## usage guide
in python, simply copy-paste the stuff into a new file named `inventory.py` or whatever you want, then at the start of your file write:
```python
# using "inventory.py" as the name
from inventory.py import (
  inventory,
  add,
  remove,
  list
)
```
and then you should be good. 
then from there, just use `add(item)`, `remove(item)`, and `list()` wherever you need in your code. these do exactly what they sound like.
currently these are the only commands but i will be adding more eventually

plans to turn this into a library for python rather than a file import will be addressed eventually
